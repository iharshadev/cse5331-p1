Using wound-wait for deadlock prevention

1 - Transaction T1 started - b1
2 - T1 applied read-lock on item Y - r1(Y)
3 - T1 upgraded the lock on item Y to write 
4 - T1 applied read-lock on item Z - r1(Z)
5 - Transaction T2 started - b2
6 - Item Y already write-locked by T1. Using wound-wait to resolve conflict - r2(Y)
7 - T2 blocked for read-lock on item Y. REASON: Older transaction T1 has applied write lock on it. - r2(Y)
8 - Transaction T3 started - b3
9 - T3 applied read-lock on item Z - r3(Z)
10 - Older transaction T1 applied write-lock on Z - w1(Z)
11 - Aborting transaction T3. REASON: Older transaction T1 applied write-lock on Z - w1(Z)
	T3 released lock on item Z
12 - T1 upgraded the lock on item Z to write 
13 - Transaction T1 committed. Releasing all locks held - e1
	T1 released lock on item Y
	T1 released lock on item Z
14 - T2 resumed operation from wait-list for item Y. - e1
15 - T2 applied read-lock on item Y - r2(Y)
16 - Transaction T2 committed. Releasing all locks held - e2
	T2 released lock on item Y
