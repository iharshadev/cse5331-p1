Using wound-wait for deadlock prevention

1 - Transaction T1 started - b1
2 - T1 applied read-lock on item Y - r1(Y)
3 - T1 applied read-lock on item Z - r1(Z)
4 - Transaction T2 started - b2
5 - T2 applied read-lock on item Y - r2(Y)
6 - Transaction T3 started - b3
7 - T3 applied read-lock on item Y - r3(Y)
8 - T1 upgraded the lock on item Z to write 
9 - Transaction T1 committed. Releasing all locks held - e1
	T1 released lock on item Y
	T1 released lock on item Z
10 - Older transaction T2 applied write-lock on Y - w2(Y)
11 - Aborting transaction T3. REASON: Older transaction T2 applied write-lock on Y - w2(Y)
	T3 released lock on item Y
12 - T2 upgraded the lock on item Y to write 
13 - T2 applied read-lock on item X - r2(X)
14 - Transaction T4 started - b4
15 - T4 applied read-lock on item Z - r4(Z)
16 - Item Y already write-locked by T2. Using wound-wait to resolve conflict - r4(Y)
17 - T4 blocked for read-lock on item Y. REASON: Older transaction T2 has applied write lock on it. - r4(Y)
18 - T2 upgraded the lock on item X to write 
19 - Transaction T2 committed. Releasing all locks held - e2
	T2 released lock on item Y
	T2 released lock on item X
20 - T4 resumed operation from wait-list for item Y. - e2
21 - T4 applied read-lock on item Y - r4(Y)
22 - T4 upgraded the lock on item Z to write 
23 - T4 upgraded the lock on item Y to write 
24 - Transaction T4 committed. Releasing all locks held - e4
	T4 released lock on item Z
	T4 released lock on item Y
